A few months ago, I started my Rails Portfolio Project, I was very excited at the moment and my schedule allowed me to work on my code more than usual, hence my knowledge about it was very fresh and expanded, even more, every day. 

Since this was a portfolio project the amount of time, I spent working on the same app was a lot, again, my knowledge was on point. I finished my app, everything worked perfectly, I accomplish each one the tasks. I recorded my videos and the only thing missing was my blog about it (this one) and uploading everything once it was done.

I had to stop my project for about 5 months, because of the Pandemic and some other life events. When I came back to finish it my mind was blank. I just couldn’t remember the basics of my app. What helped me back on track was the “READ ME” section.

Even though the “READ ME” section I did was very basic. It clearly explains how to make my app up and running. Which helped me remember everything I needed to know.

As I’m following these instructions, I notice that my code wasn’t working, but since I knew my code was working perfectly 5 months ago, the “READ ME” instructions couldn’t be wrong. So, what did I do? I read the errors my code was throwing at me and I google it. As usual, someone already had the solution for it, which I’m very thankful for. 

The error my code was giving me was 'Could not find a JavaScript runtime'. I don’t know JavaScript yet so I must admit I got scared, and remember I pause coding for roughly 5 months. But after I got the answer from Github[1], it was apparently a bug on the execJs Gem because of a Rails update. One more time I followed the instructions given and very quickly my code was up and running again. 

It is very common for gems and programs to have updates very often. This means that more times than not, probably one of those updates won’t get along with one of your gems or it will have a bug, and so on. This is why you always need to check your code often, to make sure everything is running how it's supposed to. And is the case you do have a problem with it be able to fix it right away.

I did spend more than a day trying to figure out what was wrong with my code. But once I started getting familiar with my code again everything sort of started to fall into pieces.

What Did I learn from this? Always write instructions for your app, no matter how simple and easy you think it is. Always read your error messages and then try and figure out what’s wrong. No matter if you don’t fully understand all the details within fixing your code, just keep trying different possible ways to fix it until it works, because you eventually, maybe, will understand it. Just keep trying.

These are my thoughts so far, remember I’m still learning so there’s a possibility these thoughts change with time.
