The content of your blog post goes here.For my Sinatra project, I was asked to make a CMV CRUD Application, which sounds scarier than it is. It was, and I had to put so many hours towards it, not only while I was coding, but also when I was not coding but thinking about what behavior I wanted my application to have, how many URLs, how many models, how much user-friendly can I make it. In the end, it was all worth it.

When I was first working on my project, before I submitted it and got approved, I made a skeleton of what my application needed to have. I can say that I felt overwhelmed at this point, too many ideas, too many things to do, too many files interconnected, I didn't know where to start. So I tried to simplify it, how? "One step at a time."

My "One step at a time" was my way of having everything done without overthinking how many hours it was to take me to finish this project or this skeleton. Every idea I had I just wrote it down and then I started developing a little bit more, as other parts of my frame emerge. When I actually started working on my code, I did it along with videos from flatiron lessons, older lessons( yes, plural), and my dear friend google.

I struggled with Active Record. But I knew this was going to happen, it was a weakness for me. I was prepared for that. So when I had to start my project again because I couldn't make something work, it wasn't so bad. The second time I decided to start with my tables, to avoid having to start for the 3rd time. I'm glad to say that right now Active Record is not a weakness anymore. All the research that I had to do on how to delete a table or change or add a table worked so well. I was able to play so much with this Rake that I am not afraid anymore of making mistakes, because I know it can be fixed one way or another.

I think that we should have more projects where we have to start from scratch and make it work from nothing like this one because the attention you put into the details when you do it this way is far more than when you're just trying to pass tests.  It helps you understand better the connection between files, the gems you included, and more.

Overall, my advice is "You got this!" If you got this far is because you have the knowledge "One step at a time."
