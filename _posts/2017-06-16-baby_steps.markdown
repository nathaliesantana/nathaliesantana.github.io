My curiosity for coding came a long time ago. When I just finished College so I started learning a bit about HTML and CSS. Then life happens and I just did not keep going with something that I felt really connected to.

For me coding means solutions. Every problem have multiples ways to resolve them, there is always a way around it. Not every solution is the same and everyone can aport to the solution to find a better one. 

Im not too much of a writter (blog writter), but I am really interested in what I am learning now and I really want to do this now and in the future. I love to learn (in general, not just how to code) and I love how to solve this problems feel. I am not going to lie, it can get frustrating sometimes, the road to find the problem, but in the same path is so much what you learn and the results are definitly worth it.

Lets see how this road goes.
