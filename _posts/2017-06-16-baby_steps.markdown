My curiosity for coding born years ago. When I finished College I started learning about HTML and CSS, it was just a basic course but I fell in love with it. Then life happened and I didn't keep going with something that I felt really connected to, instead, I focus only on my career.

Coding for me means solutions. Every problem has multiples ways to solve it, there's always a way around it. Not every solution is the same, and everyone can aport to the solution, which is how the real world should work, a community of people working towards the same goal, finding the best solution.

Since I started learning here I've been loving it, most of the time. I'm not going to lie, sometimes I get frustrated when I can't find the solution to a problem. I need to remember myself that I am learning, that I'm home alone, but I have a  big online community that's always willing to help when I cry for help. On the other hand, when I find the solution, **OMG!** it's SO satisfying, it's the best feeling in the world, you need to feel to know it. I think that is one of the reasons why I  keep going.

It's been difficult this last year, and I haven't made as much progress as I wanted too, but I am confident that it will be better from now on.

I'm not too much of a writer (blog writer), but I am really interested in what I am learning. So let's see how this road goes. I will keep you posted.
